4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It would be FANTASTIC if it didn't show people in my recommended friends list who aren't from my city, state, or even country. I don't live in Saudi Arabia, India, Russia, or Pakistan. If there is a way to turn this off, that would be very much appreciated. Everything else is relatively fine. I just tried using location services, but it would still be nice to be able to restrict the areas where the recommend friends list searches. Sorry if this was a bit rantish. Edit: It didn't fkn work."
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ok so, this watch videos while browsing is the stupidest thing i have ever seen. I was scrolling in the video section and a clip of a guy getting his troath cut of by a chainsaw appeared. I quickly wanted to quit the video but it kept playing up in the corner for another 3 seconds. I have tried to find a way to disable this 'play while browsing' thing but cannot find it. Please remove it or make so you can disable it. Super frustrating."
3 September 2017,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Hello facebook managementüòä i just want to SUGGEST that in every photo album there is one button that saying private all photos or pictures.. or in every individual pictures there is also and option same as i mention above. so this way we will not open pictures one by one for me to make it private.. thank you so much #philippines
4 September 2017,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wasn't using this app for about 2-3 months till now , because it was not optimized and was too laggy. But today when i accidentally update this app and giving it a try after that.... really facebook you have done a great job this time for optimizing this app. Now the app is looking simple and fast (which it have to be) . So thanks for this much needed update. device - samsung galaxy s7"
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gone backwards. Let us choose the default order. And not as screen overlayed on the order you wyant us to use. And now I can't see the notifications tab from the 'Most recent' screen. And now it ignores my 'open links externally' preference for some sites. Tapping on a friend's comment highlighted beneath a long thread doesn't take me to the comment
1 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Facebook market place on my android phone crashes RELIGIOUSLY. also read fb is intentionally doing this to find out who stays. Either way thanks for the headache and frustration. Also...thanks for for banning my other accounts I used for role playing. Thanks for deleting important post you see as spam. And lastly thanks for deleting random hot female friends off my friends list. Tell mark sucker-berg he owes me one million bucks for pain and suffering.
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is it so large just to be a glorified web page reader. And I get notifications even though I turned everything off in my profile. I have a feeling deleting facebook alltogether is next. So tired of the invasiveness. You click to hide something and it just stays in your feed. And now the marketplace in the feed that you can't get rid of. And the ""stories i have no interest in"". This app just gets worse and worse. Why do people have to plan events on here, I really want to just delete Facebook"
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wouldn't be better not to have the home page full of old posts from days ago, birthday wishes that show up for weeks and people becoming friend with people I don't know? I mean why on Earth a developer would code the newsfeed with such terrible rules? On top of ads, suggested posts, sponsored posts, useless posts of someone who liked a random group or shop or restaurant or whatever thing that I am not interested in. This is awful... Do Facebook developers actually use Facebook? It definitely doesn't seem so."
1 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your latest update sucks and I still can't watch videos. I can't seem to access the marketplace app either and I want to sell some things. My boyfriend has it on his phone, why can't I get it? I have already uninstalled and then reinstalled your app thinking that might remedy the problem, but it didn't work and every time I try to report the problem on your app itself, it just shuts down!"
2 September 2017,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Okay so it looks cool but I seem to see little change in the app itself and don't download the new messenger either a real let down üòê I mean. Come on Mark your people could keep it The same I just feel like it's a waste of space
3 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well it would be better if you could actually get an email with a code to reset your password. Ive looked at all my spam, junkmail and blocked settings and yes I've checked with my internet email provider and they are not blocking your emails!. You should NOT have to create a new account just because fb can't send an email to reset it!!!!!"
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Really? I trusted your credibility on your ads quality and your verification processes. And now you sent your scam/spam ads to my news feed!? Maybe I'm too stupid to use my real phone number and address to register their stuff... (Too stupid to trust in Facebook already verify them as qualified promotion.) Now I'm receiving endless scam and promotion calls!!~üòÜüòÜüòÜ THANK YOU Facebook ads team. Nice job !
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Getting worse on every update. Can't default to 'Most Recent' posts, then can't see notifications when on Most Recent. Too damn many ads. Seeing nothing but posts from people liking something. Videos don't want to load. And now in the middle of a video, stops and plays another damn ad, and won't let you continue with the video until you watch their ad. I get the reason for ads, but when that is all you see, then what is the point of even using FB?"
2 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Nexus 5 user. SERIOUS ISSUES that need to get fixed. The second update since I left this review didn't fix the issue either, so please do so in the next one. 1. Exiting a video, doesn't stop it. The video starts playing in pop out mode automatically and it can't be closed (because pop up videos can't be closed like they used to, which is another issue that needs fixing). Even when exiting videos after they end, they pop out and start replaying from the beginning. 2. When I turn my phone to landscape mode, I can see my navbar. I wish this wasn't the case. This works on any app, so why can't it work in Facebook too and it used to work, so it's not some new feature I'm asking for."
3 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"SO many updates but so many issues STILL! When I checked my 'most recent' on September 4th (after newest update), the most recent story was from approximately 24 hours earlier... It just became worse after that- 1st September, 31st August... C'mon you guys! I get that the app is free, but seriously... Please fix the basics!"
4 September 2017,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the fact and reality, that I can now keep in touch with my old friends that were classmates, stay in touch with my family and share pictures with them of my sons and grandbabies. As we'll as 21st y in touch with my sons no matter where they are too, such a great app. Thank you"
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app has improved since I first installed it but recent updates seem to have reversed this and now it's become a serious memory hog. Couple that with frequent restarts and I'm beginning to go off it. Ordering of the news feed seems to have changed too and its now much less interesting and the adverts are too prominent. I find I am using the Facebook app less and less.
2 September 2017,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Can't tag one specific friend, in my phone's mobile browser I can, but not in the application. Is there anything I could do to fix this? Edit: The issue has spread like a disease and now I can't tag people in Messenger either. Please, is there any way to fix this???"
2 September 2017,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Video problem I love you face book, but dont know what happend to your video loading in new update, not loading or low quality loading or low and high and low and high quality, again again again. Whats wrong with you man??? I put you on best quality if available, but you play my videos on low quality, why? By the way i checked the app setting and i didnt find any option to set. Thank you my mate, please get fixed quickly and let me know.üòò"
3 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"YET ANOTHER UPDATE....WISH MY SALARY GOT THIS MANY..why are you unable to get it right??? sometimes easier to uninstall and CONSIDER reinstalling... beginning of the end for me i'm thinking. Unbelievable, not another up date...they are now coming on a daily basis and still it doesn't '''improve the quality of speed and reliability''' .can somebody at Facebook get a grip?"
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since I upgraded my phone to the Droid turbo 2 this app constantly freezes, crashes, just closes itself. It could very well be my phone because I've uninstalled/reinstalled Facebook still doesn't work correctly"
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Still can't seem to get it right! Why can you not just fix the time line?? I don't get it. You did it on Facebook and since buying instagram you did it there too! It's the most annoying thing ever! And what about the ""suggested posts"".. Annoying as well. Should remove that all together."
3 September 2017,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hello Facebook, I want suggest please put pause button on videos, Because sometime we need to stop media,but whenever touch the centre it's poped out in full screen and we gonna back so, put pause button in normal view also. Than i will give five star.."
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So after several updates facebook still freezes when you click a picture? Takes several attempts of clicking pressing back clicking pressing back etc Over a year now and still cant fix anything! And now with latest updates you no longer allow the notification sound to be changed! Pathetic it's like you do the opposite of what billions of people want?
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8.0 Pixel XL app update has made it very frustrating. The back button no longer exits the app. If Facebook is open on my phone and I turn the screen off it takes 20 seconds for the screen to come back on when I press the power button. It has slowed and bogged my phone down to the point of app deletion.
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the update I can't access messenger from the Facebook app, I have to exit the Facebook app and go onto the messenger app manually. So annoying! And messages don't come up on my screen I have to manually look for myself to see if there's any"
2 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Raoul is rite litrally 2 days ago I updated FB 41mb or more those mb add one day it will take my last bit of memory and you know what for....... (reliability and improvements ) jerk of mark Zuckerberg what a joke he is
2 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great way to keep up with what your family and friends are doing but why does Facebook need to have access to my entire device like being able to look through my camera and listen to what I'm saying whenever they want and to look at my calender and browser history. This app would get 5 stars if it wasn't for that. It is just creepy.
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app would be 5 stars if it just had a way to turn OFF the constant event reminder SPAM. I'm getting reminders from events I never even signed up for even agreed to attend. Absolutely frustrating. If there's a setting to turn of these so-called event reminders it's not obvious in the app's Notification Settings nor in it's regular App Settings.
3 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it is good.but it is not good. bez lots of unnecessary post,unnecessary video are available here. facebook should be used in development of people,society.now a days its misused.if my word read markzugar berg its founder.plz re think again,i know u donate lots of money.if u crate its real uses for all of them.may be its great donate for our people"
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app will not stop sending me notifications. I deleted the app for the countless amount of spam it sends me and it still finds a way to send me messages on people I have no interest in knowing. I can't wait for the day when this app is a distant memory. If I could give less then 1 star I would.
3 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After yet another large update with no visible changes, FB crashing often. Scale it down to a simple fast app and quit pushing your flea market sales site. And how many times do I have to say I don't want to see this ad until you actually remove that particular ad"
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why on earth would you make a new feature like videos playing while browsing but not out a disable option in the APP SETTINGS? It's very annoying. It's like you all are going backwards in design. Listen to your users.
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new video update is terrible. Back out of watching a video and it continues playing in a box which you can't exit it. Also go back to chronological order, why do apps think it's a great idea to do this random order. Fix up"
2 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I Love The App! But My Facebook Is Not The Same At The Picture, I Hope You Can Fix That On My Samsung Galaxy Tab E SM-T561, DO IT FOR BETTER REVIEWS FOR YOUR APPS!"
4 September 2017,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,While I have minor issues with the app itself but I terms of here everything is so slow and confusing. I just want all of my stuff to transfer from one to the other so I don't have to waste my time with setup
4 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Facebook is repeatedly asking me to update the app. I click the link that brings me to the Google play store and there is no update. It's getting very annoying. I have deleted Facebook and reinstalled it and no difference. Can someone fix this issue?
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Remove the small floating video after you exit the original video. I hated YouTube for doing this also. When I hit the back button on a video it's because I don't want to watch the video anymore, I don't want to have to swipe a mini video off the screen now as well. Get rid of it, stop trying to fix something that isn't broken!"
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tries too hard to be a part of every aspect of social media and clutters up screen space doing so. The result is a bunch of features I don't even use, taking up valuable phone space. Accidentally tapping on those features is really annoying too. Not a fan of Facebook dictating what social media means to me."
3 September 2017,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Only time I can get a good deal on my family and friends. Thanks for your help getting with my family's in the area of my city's . Please find my attached updated the address 111high St climax springs, Mo. 65324 I love you and miss you. I hope you have been well with the family but I am so far away from you soon I hope I can see you soon."
2 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I always used facebook. And I like it very much. because I can communicate to our cousins from far away. But why it always crashes when I do update it. It always says oh your facebook is need to uninstall blah blah. Its annoying! üòë please fix it properly. Thank youüëç
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hitting the back button to close the app takes me to the top of the feed and refreshs Facebook. That was annoying but this pop out videos are absolutely terrible and there isn't an option to turn it off? This is ridiculous.
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tired of hiding unnecessary feeds (more than 100 per day), which are no way related to me...like some of my friend liked his friend's friend's friend's...... post or became friends with someone whom I don't know or liked something and I have nothing to do with that. Why u are showing those updates to me. I can unfollow those friends but then I will miss direct posts from my friends too, which I don't want. At least give some option that when I follow someone, I get the option to select if I only want to see direct posts from them or all their activities. Have dropped you several mails regarding this but fell to deaf ears."
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After years of use this app is no longer about and for it's people, just like our government it sold out to self interested companies. If I'm wrong someone please explain why I have to watch 3 comercial during a 13 min video. You're putting more importance on those intrusive comercial. This app used to be great I for one no longer beleave that. Remove comercials from my video!"
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what y'all did but after the update, this app always crashes now... It's been months and y'all still have not fixed anything. This app crashes all the time now. Stop playing your games..."
4 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"First, there are some really great features. Facebook is still awesome to use. But there are still many problems. Double notification posts have been going on for a while now. And now notifications are broken. They just take you to another version of the profile's home page. Video problems, like always. Videos pop up in wrong posts. Video audio was still playing even after closing it. Pressing ""See More"" to read the description on a video that is fullscreen means you want to actually read it, not make it disappear 3 seconds after pressing it. Just please don't add anything new when the app still needs fixing and major improvements on user experience."
4 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Wow, the performance of this App is so poor! When you try and open it it just freezes up, often crashing completely. Scrolling is not at all fluid either, and it will often randomly open a link in a post you scroll past without you even selecting it."
3 September 2017,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best thing to keep in touch with friends, family and creeping others. Best for finding out dirt before the news, celebrity death, future babies. Event planner. And for keeping you out of complete bordem when your popping or being socially aqward around humans."
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hate facebooks ID checks...asks you what people call you everyday then asks you for government issued documents to validate your official name. No hiding from stalkers on Facebook. .gonna move to Instagram i think.
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Oh my, please stop. I have 1 ad for every 5 of my friend posts I scroll through. I do not want any of the product or pages advertised. If I need a product, I will independently research one. It is ridiculous that I have to go through so many ads, and in video ads. Because we all know, Facebook hasn't made enough money. My ""most recent,"" constant resets itself while i am mid article. Seriously, no trending anymore? Bring it back please. And the Live feature is simply obnoxious. I DON'T CARE if someone is live. At all. Please stop adding features that are just bloated and a data suck. Every time i get a notification, a new Facebook window opens. Huge memory suck."
3 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Why am I seeing days old posts at the top of my newsfeed all the time... Pointless and a waste of time. Not enjoying Facebook at the moment it's made itself very boring reading the same stuff over and over again
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"notifications no longer working.... keeps logging me out... same for the stupid separate messenger app... these use up far to much phone resources. Facebook without notifications, what's the point???? Unsociable network."
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I hate it because someone is using my earlier account which he/she hacked then I reported to you guys and instead of helping me you disabled my account whereas am the victim here. I submitted my passport and identity card currently in where am located but you do nothing. Facebook team you are unbelievably suckin
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All videos get froze without any reason, and now on Facebook is videos everywhere. So if I can't play the damned videos what else can I do in this app? Nothing else is interesting"
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are so many updates, like every week. I don't see any improvement from the previous version. The latest version has made the app worst by making the icons bigger. Please provide updates when necessary."
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For this version every time I watch a video and back out of it for Android, it automatically opens a thumbnail of the video I can't get rid of unless I close the app. Please fix this, it's extremely annoying and unnecessary"
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You change the app every other week, generally making it worse. If it works, don't change it. You're not improving anything, nor are you making any fixes. You need to hire people who know what they're doing."
2 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,When on WiFi videos are often stop to load and you can watch them only for 4-7 seconds after need to wait again for 20 seconds. All other social media apps are working normal and I can watch videos on wifi without freezing. On mobile data this app works fine. Please fix this issue.
3 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Video playback is horrible. Constantly buffers between not even a few seconds of playing. Posts from days and days ago in the news feed. The app updates regularly but nothing ever changes.
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Videos only playing in 360p max on WiFi or 4G, I know it's not my phone since the screen resolution is 2k. Issues started after the most recent update."
4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The features and the functionality of this app are great for facebook. One MAJOR issue is the number of times it crashes. It must crash close to 50 times/day on my ZTE Axon phone and i cant blame the phone because it's the only app that crashes at all. None of my other appd have EVER crashed. Ill revise this review once an update is released.
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You ass holes remove posts and block accounts which dont violate your terms of service. Youre left wing garbage shutting down people who speak the truth while allowing jihadists to recruit through your site.
4 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This new update is causing me to notbe able to post any statuses or caption what im sharing. It's very annoying. I'm just now realizing that all my statuses was not posted lately. Fix it now!
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"*update* This new update makes fb worse! Why do I want sound blaring out of videos I haven't pressed to see? It even overrides my silent function on the phone!?!?! And don't make the scrolling stop and pause over ads so that it eventually clicks onto them when you are trying to scroll on... Do you obviously think we are stupid? I'm still fed up of everything being out of chronological order, it still drives me nuts, especially when I get phone calls and texts from people thinking that I hate their work, or I'm not being sympathetic to their cause/illness when in reality I haven't seen one single post from them. There are people that I don't see posts from for weeks then bam I get half a dozen that's been posted over a period of a month!!!!!! And how the hell do you know what I want to see in my time line?!?!?!"
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the recent update. My account does nothing. Newsfeed doesn't load, profile doesn't load, can't access pictures, messenger doesn't work. It's basically an app sitting on my phone that I can't get rid of. Interestingly enough my account doesn't work on any platform. For 3 days. Why can't they just leave it alone? It's already so full of ads, can't imagine them doing anything worth while at this point. Is there a way to give zero stars??"
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Comments not always visible. When tagging inside comments, friends links display behind keypad so can't select link. Search feature has disappeared as has messenger link (although the latter may be by design). Very slow to load. Feed not showing all updates from friends. Need I go on..."
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Trouble updating..For some reason during the updating Facebook gets ""UNINSTALLED""!!!! Now I can't install it.. I tried all their trouble shooting ideas. But still will not instal.. It happened before but it installed with no problem...on my Samsung tablet.. No problems on my LG smartphone."
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Taking too much space. And when a hater reported your account, fb didn't do a good job protecting you and instead disabled your account without warning. Demand for ID card for verification but not let all the honest people passed"
4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Every time I go to leave a reaction on a picture or video, my reaction gets 'rejected'. It never shows up or saves like I had never even pressed the button. It's quite annoying, please fix!"
3 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,We can only see one vedio at a time but in previous version we can see more vedio after scroll bar down and after few mentues when we are using Facebook suddenly Facebook is close. Please Dev look into the same and fixed the issue. Thanks Jasveer Singh Software developer
4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The notifications I get for posts in pages aren't redirecting properly anymore, now the just show me a bunch of unrelated posts from that page. This started after the last update, please work on it..."
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You cant even put a picture on comment anymore.. weekly update but you guys making worst.. you want us to use pc to put some pictures on comment. Hello android phones are like pc these days... are you guys thinking or just want to go back in stone age???
2 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate this app. It eats my ability to develop programs connect with peripherals. Sorry to my carrier Qualcomm for putting up with this goofy stuff. I can't remove app from phone, no control over unremovable app, or messenger, which is also making me want to vomit. I can't control when it decides to update itself. I can't seem to be able to remove it. I am going to close my Facebook account. Sorry high school yearbook friends and family... I deactivated my account after ten years. In two weeks, hasta la vista, facebook! Citizens could do better. Shame. Meet me online somewhere else. McPrivacy Burger tastes like failure."
3 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Feed refreshes automatically, meaning if I click a link or article that interests me, read/look at it and then go back to read the comments, I'm unable to because the feed refreshes itself and the link/article is lost. This really reduces engagement - I'm not going to read the comments BEFORE I read the article, so to remove the ability to read comments after opening the article is extremely limiting. It's also annoying that when a friend's comment on an article is highlighted on the news feed, clicking on said comment doesn't take you to it, instead showing loads of random people's, which aren't what I always want to read. I would actually engage on Facebook a lot more if these issues were resolved. As it is, I mostly use it to remember birthdays and find articles to read (but never join the conversation about)."
4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like Facebook and use it everyday, but I just have 2 complaints. 1, I get really annoyed when I'm in replies and someone comments, and I'm still in the replies and I get a notification they replied anyway. I know they did. I'm still here. 2, I get really annoyed when I'm looking at a post and it's a video or a post with a lot of photos, and I click on it, then a while later I click out of it and it reloaded and I just lost the post. Or it randomly reloads."
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE FACEBOOK ALLOW CONDONE PEOPLE TO GET KILLED! I SEEN A VIDEO OF TWO GUYS GOT SHOT THEN THERE BODY SET ON FIREüò≠üò≠. So when I reported it. They said they didn't see anything wrong with the video! Are you Kidding me!! What do you mean you don't see anything wrong with it!! Was my response to it.. So I will no long deal with Facebook because of this. I will take my business some where else. But I will NOT STAND FOR THIS!! THAT WAS BEYOND WRONG. MAYBE FACEBOOK SHOULD HOOK UP WITH POLICE AROUND THE WORLD THEN THIS KIND OF HEARTLESS ACTION CAN BE FIX.. Until they take a stand. I am done..EVIL PEOPLE SMH!! Sad...
3 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,First of all it have a brain of its own as it automatically shuts down without taking permission. Secondly the Search option never works correctly and sometimes it just opens up.. Thirdly I uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it's showing not installed....it automatically uninstalled itself
4 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While I still use this app often, it has gotten to the point where the ads are blatantly invasive. And the only option we have is to provide information so that we can receive more personalized ads? Way to throw your users to the lions."

4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am a new FB user. Was enjoying connecting with family and friends until it logged me out for some security issue. Requested photo for proof of ID. I am still logged out and cannot get logged in. Annoyed!!! 9/3rd & 4th/2017 Deleted app until you fix it!
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All of a sudden I can no longer upload photos. When I try to upload photos to Facebook it takes me ONLY to very old photos and won't even show me recent ones, making this Facebook app all but useless. All's still good if I go to Facebook from browser. It's this stupid app. Once it works, STOP changing it u guys. You're screwing up your own product. Sent from Sony Experia 10"
4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Luv this app. But today I have not been able to view photos in photo albums or post more pics to photo albums. It's driving me bonkers. Please fix this. I luv my Facebook! Can't live without it.
4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,You keep updating it every 3 days and it keeps crashing and being unresponsive!! I have enough memory so that is not the problem. Please fix it finally!
3 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,How do I switch off (forever) this stupid video window after I watched video and then came back to news feed ? I hate this. I want to be able to switch it off
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Quit trying to fix what isn't broke. Facebook was fine without the new window to view videos when you back out of it. If I'm backing out of a video, I'm done watching it. No need to replay it for me again. Also, get rid of the ads. They ruin almost every video I watch now. If I weren't so far from friends and family, I'd have deleted Facebook a long time ago."
3 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Go to free button doesn't work. You know what that means? My prepaid credits are gone. Hated it even more that you can't load in 10Mbps connection. How awful
4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can't live w/it, can't live w/o it. Y'all sit around in a Mad Hatter's tea party & say ""Time for a New Look!"" Y'all finally cut out 20 MB of excessive size & fluff! Impressed! But, Share button still limited; updates force relearning & remains to be seen if this is an improvement. FB ain't the only app, but I guess now we can keep a few others."
4 September 2017,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the latest update, this app has been slow, freezes constantly, and my new favorite feature: The refresh news feed and notification buttons are now on the bottom of the screen and since I have a Pixel, the home and back buttons that are on my screen and in the same spot overlap, making it impossible to touch the buttons in-app. I'm sure I'm not the only person experiencing this. A minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things, but definitely worth mentioning. Hoping you can fix this quickly for anyone who has their home and back buttons on the touch screen rather than on the bezel. Thank you!"
1 September 2017,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Others say this app update sucks, No! Its awesome.. The problem is not the app but your phone, I dont know but I think the version of your phone is not compatible with it. Good Job Facebook you work well and beautiful."
4 September 2017,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The past updates are very annoying.

4 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Facebook should get rid of the top stories feed entirely! Nobody wants to see old posts and miss out on new ones! To get the most recent posts, click the far right ""menu"" button and scroll down to ""most recent"". Another thing is the ridiculous algorithm they use to determine what you want to see. I miss so many great posts because it hides them thinking I'm not interested. Get rid of that! Show me everything. That's why these people are friends and these pages are liked, obviously! If I don't want to see what they post, I'll unfollow them myself."

2 September 2017,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Far better than previous versions. Still i have a suggestion. Four tabs are there. Irritating that you got groups posts in news feed even though there is a specific tab named groups. Move groups posts from news feed tab to groups tab.

4 September 2017,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too bloated and seems to just get more and more so. Sliding down the top drawer and it seems like it's trying to be its own OS, and can confuse regular users into thinking they have opened the Android top drawer. Instead, focus on resource usage (!), package size when installed (it's huge!), and make the UI simpler and easier to get around. Settings should be in one place, called Facebook Settings for example, and not spread over App Settings and tons of other places that uses WebViews that has really confusing back navigation (go deep and seems like you're back to where you started without settings saved although they are). Basically look at apps like Twitter and Google+. This app needs to adhere to Material Design, although it has improved somewhat, and not try to use its own design and especially navigation style. Also as a developer I don't see the need for ""NotificationService"" and ""MessagingService"" when all not in-app notifications are disabled and Facebook Messenger is installed which runs a service with the same name. Resource waste and services running when not needed (names suggest so) is bad bad and only reason I can think of is collecting and sending all data you can get from my device, and the names are therefore false and should be addressed by Google because this is probably a violation of their guidelines (running unnecessary services is one example only). Also restarting services when an app is force stopped from Android settings should not be possible before the app is opened again, but Facebook and Messenger does it and it must be a violation using some hacky workaround to make sure these data collection/spy services run all the time."
